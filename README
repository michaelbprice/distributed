A cross-platform distributed build system.

Goals:
1) Portability across several flavors of operating systems and processors
2) Simple build agent deployment and registration
3) Support for multiple compilers/languages, focusing first on C++
4) Distribution decisions based upon heuristics and historical data
5) Agile, not chaotic
